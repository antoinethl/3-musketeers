# Currency 

cli.js allows you to convert money using differents currencies.


STEP 1 : INSTALLATION

Using your shell :
Be sure that you are in the /YOURWORKSPACE/3-musketeers/currency/ path.

> npm install
> node cli.js

If everything is working, you should see the default conversion returned: 
	1 USD = 0.00011470533918942325 BTC


STEP 2 : HOW TO USE IT

You can choose the amount to convert, and 2 currencies for the conversion:

> node cli.js <amount> <currency1> <currency2>

For example:

> node cli.js 4 EUR USD 

Here I asked to convert 4 EUR (euros) to USD (US Dollars):
4 EUR = 4.4468 USD
